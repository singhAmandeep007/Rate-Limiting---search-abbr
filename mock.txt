//  Ques #3 of 3

/* Aman, you need to write an endpoint - 
   http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=alx
   that does a fuzzy search (partial search)
   on the names that are inside the names.json
   file provided to you.

   @param q: query paramter which is the search term

   So the conditions are - the name doesn't need 
   to be an exact match. 

   Imagine a name - Amandeep

   All these queries are valid for "Amandeep"
   q=adp
   q=amnp
   q=a
   q=AmAn
   q=Adeep

   Invalid entries - which shouldn't return "Amandeep"
   q=Apman
   q=anm
   q=ape

   You can use regular expressions if you like (regex)
   but would be better if you do it the vanilla way.


   Also, to continue where we left, you need to write a 
   middleware - `rateLimit` that makes sure, the endpoint
   cannot be hit by a certain `IP` for more than 5 times in 
   a minute. If the user (IP) exceeds the limit, return a
   status code of `429` with a message "Limit exceeded"
